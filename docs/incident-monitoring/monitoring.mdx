_Overview of how we monitor our Production systems_

## Logs and metrics

All services that we look after either produce logs or metrics. Both are key for us to monitor to make sure the systems are healthy and operating quickly.

We process logging in the following format:

The generally accepted format for a log string is the following:

```
{UTC-timestamp} [{log-level}] <{file}:{line-number}> {message}
```

For example:

```log
2019-09-06 10:47:50.099Z [DEBUG] <mailsend.py:13> Hello world!
```

Logs include key information such as what the system is doing if it had any errors and external interactions with other services.

Metrics time-series streams of timestamped values. For example, an API might have 4 requests for a specific endpoint each minute. A metric would be used to track this to track usage.

## DataDog

We use DataDog to consume all of our metrics, logs and integrate with our cloud providers. It is a SaaS DevOps monitoring solution that allows the SRE team to create monitors against all the logs and metrics we receive With these monitors we can alert our incident management
system PagerDuty and slack.

## PagerDuty

We use PagerDuty to manage our incidents, schedule who's on call and automate the calling of a team member when an incident occurs.
